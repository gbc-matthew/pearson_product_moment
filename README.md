# The Pearson Product Moment
From: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient
    ```Pearson's correlation coefficient is the
    covariance of the two variables divided by
    the product of their standard deviations.
    The form of the definition involves a "product moment",
    that is, the mean (the first moment about the origin)
    of the product of the mean-adjusted random variables```

## Function 
```pearson_correlation(X, Y)```
### Arguments
  ```X list of data set 1```
  ```Y list of data set 2```
